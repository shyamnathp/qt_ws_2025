---

### **Slide 3: Modern Developer Expectations**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "Developers today expect frameworks to support cross-platform development, rapid iteration, and multi-language integration."
- Emphasize the shift: "While C++ remains a cornerstone, developers increasingly use languages like Python and Rust."
- Transition: "Let’s explore why multi-language support is so important."

---

### **Slide 4: Why Multi-Lang Support Matters**
**Time: 3 minutes**
- "Multi-language support allows developers to use their preferred languages while leveraging established frameworks."
- Highlight benefits:
  - "It bridges modern languages with mature frameworks."
  - "Enables scalability for large projects."
  - "Promotes reusability across multiple languages."
- Transition: "Now, let’s look at how Qt can support new languages."

---

### **Slide 5: Supporting New Languages in Qt**
**Time: 1 minute**
- "There are two main approaches to supporting new languages in Qt."
- Transition: "Let’s explore the first option."

---

### **Slide 6: Option 1 – Rewrite Qt in New Languages**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "Rewriting Qt in new languages might seem like a good idea, but it’s not practical."
- Discuss challenges:
  - "Massive effort: Years of development and testing."
  - "Loss of maturity: Decades of optimizations would be lost."
  - "Fragmentation risk: Splitting the community."
- Transition: "This brings us to a more feasible option."

---

### **Slide 7: Option 2 – Create Language Bindings**
**Time: 3 minutes**
- "Language bindings allow us to preserve Qt’s maturity while enabling incremental adoption."
- Highlight PySide6 as an example: "PySide6 is a successful implementation of this approach."
- Transition: "Let’s meet the tool that powers PySide6."

---

### **Slide 8: Meet Shiboken**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "Shiboken is the tool that generates Python bindings for Qt."
- Mention its key features:
  - "Supports advanced C++ features."
  - "Simplifies binding creation."
- Transition: "For developers new to Shiboken, we have a visual tool."

---

### **Slide 9: Shiboken Wizard**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "The Shiboken Wizard is a visual tool for creating Python bindings."
- Highlight benefits:
  - "No Shiboken expertise required."
  - "Perfect for developers new to binding creation."
- Transition: "Let’s see how it works."

---

### **Slide 10: Shiboken Wizard Installation & Usage**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- Briefly describe the installation process.
- Play the demo video: "Here’s a quick look at how the Shiboken Wizard simplifies binding creation."

---

### **Slide 11: Why Should C++ Developers Care?**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "C++ developers can use Python for rapid prototyping without recompiling."
- Highlight extensibility: "Make your application scriptable for easier customization."
- Transition: "Let’s look at an example."

---

### **Slide 12: QtPythonScripting**
**Time: 3 minutes**
- Walk through the code example:
  - "This shows how to register a C++ type with Python."
  - "Developers can use Python to manipulate C++ objects seamlessly."
- Transition: "This approach combines the best of both worlds."

---

### **Slide 13: Unified Frontend, Multiple Backends**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "The future of Qt lies in a unified frontend with multiple backend language support."
- Highlight QML as the universal frontend: "QML simplifies backend integration and lowers the entry barrier."
- Transition: "Let’s see how other frameworks are embracing multi-language support."

---

### **Slide 14: Multi-Language Success Stories**
**Time: 3 minutes**
- Discuss examples:
  - "Tauri: Modern web frontend with Rust backend."
  - "Flutter: Single Dart frontend with multiple backend options."
  - "Electron: Web tech frontend with flexible backend support."
- Transition: "Qt is uniquely positioned to lead in this space."

---

### **Slide 15: Proven Foundation**
**Time: 2 minutes**
- "Qt has a proven foundation with tools like Shiboken and PySide6."
- Encourage further exploration: "Check out the documentation for more details."

---
